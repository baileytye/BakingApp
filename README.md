This is an educational app for the Android Nanodegree which displays movies fetched using The Movie Database.

APIs Used:  
Retrofit2.  
Picaso.   
Butterknife.  

Tests worked on a pixel 2, with animations turned off (Phone tests only). Should use a dummy input instead of fetching from network ideally.
